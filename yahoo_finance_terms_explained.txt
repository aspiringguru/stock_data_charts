Current P/E is current price over current earnings.
Forward P/E is the current price over the expected earnings per share.
When forward P/E is less than future P/E, it indicates that there is a
projected increase in earnings per share, but that can be done by an increase
in earnings and/or usually some combination of stock buybacks.

from https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-u-breaking-down-pe-ratios-144725640.html
the P/E ratio is the stock’s price divided by the earnings per share that the stock
delivered over the last 12 months (also referred to as TTM, or “trailing twelve months”).

Forward P/E ratio offers a way to measure future valuations of a company, by
measuring earnings over the next 12 months (as opposed to TTM).
